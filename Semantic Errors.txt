Types of Semantic errors:
1. Variable in a function cannot have the same name as any parameters/cannot be redeclared.
2. Global variables cannot be redeclared
3. Type mismatch (LHS is of type real and RHS is of type int)
4. Type mismatch (Adding real and int types)
5. Variable not declared
6. Addition and subtraction of different record types.
7. Type mismatch (Adding number with a record/union)
8. Constructed variable's field does not exist.
9. Number of parameters don't match in function call
10. Type of parameters don't match in function call
11. Function parameter cannot be of union type. Can be record type.
12. Infinite Loop condition. Report Line number as the line number of the iterative statement. -- 
    Basically, variables are not assigned any value
13. Recursion is not valid
14. Function Overloading is not valid
15. Function not defined before calling it
